I don’t know why ${1} always claims he’s stressed and tired. He hasn’t worked an honest day in his life, living off his parents’ money still. Although you have to admit it’s given him a lot of time to get good at his art.
${1} over there in the corner--No! Don't Look--is said to be unhappy with ${2}.
${1}'s potions are especially potent. Well worth the price premium.
${1} said "I'm going to keep drinking until ${2} start looking good."
${1} had a baby last month but notice you never see it now. Some of her friends say it died at birth, but I hear she killed it herself because something was … wrong… with it.
${1} said "I can't wait for the dance on the winter solstice. I'm going to ask ${2} to go with me."
${1} was asking people around "Do you have any coin you can lend me? I seem to have outspent the copper in my pockets."
${1} has been cutting his meat with… less savoury cuts… over at the butcher shop. Don’t know exactly what he’s adding to the sausages, but word is it isn’t what he’s advertising.
I heard old ${1} is related to the aunt of the queen, so technically is royal!
${1}s of unusual size? I don't believe they exist.
${1}'s potions are especially potent. Her cure for impotency has saved ${2} a family in this town-- wonder where she learned to make it?
Young ${1}, daughter of that fop ${2}, has her eye on the grocer’s son ${3}. He gets to see her once a week when the groceries are delivered, but I hear she’s been sneaking out into less pleasant parts of town to meet him some nights.
${1} over there collects old coins; I heard his great uncle was a metalsmithing dwarf!
Who cares about that when we're talking about ${1} the ${2}'s son running off with ${3}.
Tomorrow night ${1} the bard is coming to this stream.
${1} over there in the corner--No! Don't Look--is said to be unhappy with the ${2}.
If you're interested in the gladiator fights, bet against ${1}--I hear the fix is in.
The ${1}'s been through three food tasters this month, from what I here. Not a very secure job. Three cooks too, I s'pose.
${1} needs some horse-radish to get the smell of the sewers out of my nose. On warm days like today it is particularly fragrant.
If you're ever at The Happy Halfling ask for the ${1}. Its not on their menu.
The ${1}'s story last night was very interesting. I can see why he picked it given the politics of the day.
The general store clerk ${1} hasn't been acting herself lately.
If you want some 'special' attention, head over to ${1}.
If you want any special attention from any of the girls upstairs, ask for ${1}. She's better than any of the others.
They say room 2c upstairs is haunted. The old ${1} was found dead there.
The blacksmith ${1} does some excellent work. Supposedly his forge was built by a team of dwarves, hired from the mountains. Imagine!
The ${1}'s coffers are running empty. He's having trouble paying the militia.
They say someone found gold upriver. ${1} for one found a few ounces.
${1}'s wine is out of this world. I wonder what's in it? Ain't like no grape I ever tasted.
I hear ${1} over there knows cures for your genital issues-- the men in this town have had all sorts of problems lately.
The ${1}'s boy went missing last week. They found his body a day later, but with those gashes on him I wish they hadn't.
${1} bought some rope last week, tied it up nice and pretty-like, and carries it around in his backpack all the time. That’s kind of creepy if you ask me.
Did you hear about the festival coming next month? We're going to have ${1}. Right here just outside our humble town.
The ${1} is new here. It has really gone downhill. The mutton on the MLT isn't very lean.
The ${1}'s got three nipples.
The ${1} used to be a fancy priest, but fell on hard times when his temple closed down.
The ${1} does some excellent work. He fixed my farm tools last month.
Do you remember ${1}? I saw him, unarmed, best 5 men. Too bad about his last bout with the lions.
I hear the ${1} takes no prisoners.
${1} threw a shoe on the way here. The ${2} a few buildings over is putting all new shoes on her.
The ${1} knows everyone's secrets in this channel. They could run this place for all I know.
${1} looks a lot like ${2}.
Keep an eye on ${1}'s sleeves if you ever play cards.
${1} who hangs out at the bar a lot, buying other people drinks more than himself. He doesn’t tip well. I figure he’s working undercover, looking for someone.
I know ${1} over there knows a cure for that thing on ${2}'s cheek if you have the coin.
${1} is back together with his old love, but everyone remembers how bad of a fit they were last time. Supposedly they are living together this time. If you ask me, it sounds fishy and something is seriously wrong with this whole picture. I’m not saying that ${1} is brainwashed or being threatened, but I’m not saying he’s not…
${1} is pregnant again with her fifth child. Some say ${2} is not the father!
The best place to buy potatoes is from ${1}.
${1} is cheating on ${2} with ${3}.
I think ${1} might be pregnant, but ${2}'s been away for a year!
I prefer not to gossip.
